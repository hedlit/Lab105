  \section{Results}

  \todo[inline]{Briefly comment the results, did the script say all your solutions were correct? Approximately how long time does it take for the program to run on the largest input? What takes the majority of the time?}
  All tests passed. Parsing takes 3 seconds, going on 4 and the method takes exactly 3.
  \section{Implementation details}

  \todo[inline]{How did you implement the solution? Which data structures were used? Which modifications to these data structures were used? What is the overall running time? Why?}
  Mostly Arrays due to convenience, but Arraylist for storing the "gathered" in order not to waste memory space by initializing something too large. 
  The recursion builds on each new case being n -> n/2 and every method inside is O(1), thus we have O(nlogn).
